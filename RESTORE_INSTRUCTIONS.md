# Instructions to Restore Previous Version

## What Changed in Latest Update

### Files Modified:
1. `App.jsx` - Removed Connect to Host button, added hardcoded LAN address
2. `ServerControl.jsx` - Removed Connect button, hardcoded LAN, improved UI
3. `FileList.jsx` - Complete redesign with cards, icons, better layout
4. `FileUploadZone.jsx` - Enhanced UI with emojis and gradients

2. `ConnectionApprovalModal.jsx` - Connection approval UI
3. `ConnectionStatus.jsx` - Status banner component

## To Restore to Previous Version (Refactored with Components)

The version you want is saved in `App.refactored.jsx` which has:
- ✅ Modular component structure
- ✅ Custom hooks (useSocket, useFileUpload, useAuth)
- ✅ Utils folder with API functions
- ✅ Connect to Host button
- ✅ Dynamic LAN address from backend
- ✅ Original simple UI (no fancy gradients/emojis)

### Manual Restoration Steps:

1. **Copy App.refactored.jsx to App.jsx**
   ```bash
   cp App.refactored.jsx App.jsx
   ```

2. **Revert ServerControl.jsx** - Need original version with:
   - Start/Stop Server button
   - Connect to Host button
   - Dynamic LAN address display
   - Simple QR code toggle

3. **Revert FileList.jsx** - Need original table version

4. **Revert FileUploadZone.jsx** - Need original simple version

5. **Revert useFileUpload.js** - Remove debug logging

6. **Delete new components** (optional):
   - UploadErrorModal.jsx
   - ConnectionApprovalModal.jsx  
   - ConnectionStatus.jsx

## Quick Fix

Since the components were heavily modified, the easiest way is to:

1. Keep the current `App.refactored.jsx` as reference
2. Manually recreate the simple component versions
3. Or restore from git if you have version control

## What the Previous Version Had

- Clean modular structure
- Separate components for each UI section
- Custom hooks for logic
- Utils for API calls
- Simple, functional UI
- Connect to Host button working
- Dynamic backend integration
