# File Upload Fix & PIN Protection Feature

## Summary
Fixed file upload functionality and added per-file PIN protection feature allowing senders to set optional PINs on files before uploading, requiring receivers to enter the correct PIN to download.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed File Upload Issue
**Problem**: File upload was not working because `FileUploadZone` component was missing the required `onFileSelect` callback prop.

**Solution**: Added `onFileSelect` callback in `App.jsx` to handle file selection events.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/react/src/App.jsx` - Added onFileSelect prop to FileUploadZone component

---

### 2. Backend PIN Protection (app.py)

**New Features**:
- Added `FILE_PINS` dictionary to store per-file PIN codes in memory
- Modified `/upload` endpoint to accept optional `pin` form field
- Modified `/download/<filename>` endpoint to verify PIN before allowing download
- Updated `/files` endpoint to include `has_pin` flag for each file
- Updated `/delete/<filename>` endpoint to remove PIN when file is deleted
- Updated cleanup worker to remove PINs for expired files

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Per-file PIN storage
FILE_PINS = {}

# Upload with optional PIN
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file_pin = request.form.get('pin', '').strip()
    if file_pin:
        FILE_PINS[saved_name] = file_pin

# Download with PIN verification
@app.route('/download/<path:filename>', methods=['GET'])
def download_file(filename):
    if filename in FILE_PINS:
        provided_pin = request.args.get('pin', '').strip()
        if provided_pin != FILE_PINS[filename]:
            return jsonify({'error': 'invalid_pin'}), 403
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload without PIN**: Select file â†’ Upload â†’ Skip â†’ Verify file uploads
2. **Upload with PIN**: Select file â†’ Upload â†’ Set PIN "1234" â†’ Confirm â†’ Verify upload
3. **Download without PIN**: Click Download on non-protected file â†’ Verify direct download
4. **Download with correct PIN**: Click Download on protected file â†’ Enter correct PIN â†’ Verify download
