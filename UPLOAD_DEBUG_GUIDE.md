# Upload Debugging Guide

## Latest Changes Made

### 1. Fixed File Selection Display
- **Added**: Visual feedback when file is selected
- **Shows**: "‚úì File Selected: filename.txt"
- **Added**: "Clear Selection" button to reset

### 2. Removed preventDefault Bug
- **Issue**: `e.preventDefault()` in onChange was blocking file selection
- **Fixed**: Removed preventDefault from file input onChange handler
- **Result**: File selection now works properly

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging
All upload steps now log to browser console:
```javascript
// When file is selected:
"handleFileUpload called, files: FileList"
"File selected: test.txt"

// When upload button clicked:
"handleUpload called"
"Input element: <input>"
"Input element files: FileList"
"Number of files: 1"
"Selected file: File {name: 'test.txt', ...}"
"Starting upload for file: test.txt Size: 1234 PIN: No"
"Upload result: {success: true, ...}"
```

## How to Debug Upload Issues

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Clear console (trash icon)
4. Keep it open while testing

### Step 2: Test File Selection
1. Click on the upload zone
2. Select a small file (e.g., .txt file)
3. **Check Console** - Should see:
   ```
   handleFileUpload called, files: FileList {0: File, length: 1}
   File selected: yourfile.txt
   Files selected: 1
   ```
4. **Check UI** - Should see:
   ```
   ‚úì File Selected:
   yourfile.txt
   [Clear Selection]
   ```

### Step 3: Test Upload
1. With file selected, click "Upload" button
2. **Check Console** - Should see:
   ```
   handleUpload called
   Input element: <input type="file" ...>
   Input element files: FileList {0: File, length: 1}
   Number of files: 1
   Selected file: File {name: "yourfile.txt", size: 1234, ...}
   Starting upload for file: yourfile.txt Size: 1234 PIN: No
   ```

### Step 4: Check Network Request
1. Go to **Network** tab in DevTools
2. Filter by "upload"
3. Look for POST request to `/upload`
4. Check:
   - **Status**: Should be 201 (Created)
   - **Response**: Should have `filename` and `url`
   - **Request Payload**: Should show FormData with file

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Please select a file first" Error

**Symptoms**: 
- File appears selected in UI
- Click Upload ‚Üí Error modal appears
- Console shows: "No file selected!"

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Check console logs:
Input element: <input>
Input element files: null  ‚Üê PROBLEM!
Number of files: 0         ‚Üê PROBLEM!
```

**Causes**:
1. File input ref not properly initialized
2. File input cleared before upload
3. Browser security restriction

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh page and try again
2. Try different file
3. Check if antivirus is blocking
4. Try incognito mode

### Issue 2: Upload Fails with Network Error

**Symptoms**:
- File selected successfully
- Upload starts but fails
- Console shows: "Upload error: Network error"

**Debug**:
1. Check Network tab for failed request
2. Look for CORS errors in console
3. Check if backend is running

**Solutions**:
```powershell
# Check if Python server is running
Get-Process python

# Check if port 5000 is listening
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000

# If not running, start backend:
cd d:\Projects\WifiX
python app.py
```

### Issue 3: 401 Unauthorized Error

**Symptoms**:
- Upload fails with 401 status
- Console shows: "Upload failed: 401"

**Cause**: Server has ACCESS_PIN enabled

**Solution**:
1. Check if ACCESS_PIN environment variable is set
2. If yes, you need to authenticate first
3. Or temporarily disable ACCESS_PIN:
   ```powershell
   # Remove ACCESS_PIN
   $env:ACCESS_PIN = $null
   python app.py
   ```

### Issue 4: File Size Error

**Symptoms**:
- Error: "File size exceeds 1GB limit"

**Solution**:
- Use smaller file for testing (< 100MB recommended)
- Backend limit: 1GB
- Frontend limit: 1GB
- For large files, increase limits in both frontend and backend

### Issue 5: CORS Error

**Symptoms**:
- Console shows: "CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'"
- Network request shows CORS error

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Check app.py ALLOWED_ORIGINS:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get('CORS_ORIGINS', 
  'http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174,http://127.0.0.1:5173').split(',')
```

**Solution**:
1. Ensure frontend is running on port 5173
2. Ensure backend is running on port 5000
3. Check CORS_ORIGINS includes your frontend URL
4. Restart backend after CORS changes

## Still Not Working?

If upload still fails after all debugging:
