## üêõ Debugging

### If Upload Still Fails:

#### Check Console Logs:
Look for these specific messages:
```javascript
// File selection:
"Files selected: [...]"  ‚Üê Should show your files

// Upload start:
"Starting upload for file: ..."  ‚Üê Should show file name

// XHR response:
"XHR onload - Status: 201"  ‚Üê Should be 201 (success)

// If error:
"Upload failed: ..."  ‚Üê Shows specific error
```

#### Common Errors & Solutions:

**Error: "Network error"**
- **Cause**: Backend not running
- **Solution**: 
  ```powershell
  cd d:\Projects\WifiX
  python app.py
  ```

**Error: "Upload failed (401): Unauthorized"**
- **Cause**: ACCESS_PIN enabled
- **Solution**: Authenticate first or disable ACCESS_PIN

**Error: "Upload failed (500)"**
- **Cause**: Server error
- **Solution**: Check Python terminal for error details

**Error: "Failed to parse server response"**
- **Cause**: Server returned invalid JSON
- **Solution**: Check backend logs, ensure app.py is correct

**Error: "Upload timeout"**
- **Cause**: File too large or slow connection
- **Solution**: Use smaller files or increase timeout
