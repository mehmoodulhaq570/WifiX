# Quick Restore to Previous Version

## The Issue
The latest changes modified too many component files. To restore to the clean refactored version (before the UI improvements), you need to:

## Solution

### Option 1: Use Git (If Available)
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/react/src/components/
git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/react/src/App.jsx
```

### Option 2: Manual File Replacement

I've created `ServerControl.simple.jsx` with the original simple version.

**To restore, run these commands in PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd d:\Projects\WifiX\frontend\react\src

# Restore App.jsx
cp App.refactored.jsx App.jsx

# Restore ServerControl
cp components\ServerControl.simple.jsx components\ServerControl.jsx
```

Then you need to manually restore:
- `FileList.jsx` - back to simple table layout
- `FileUploadZone.jsx` - back to simple drag-drop
- `useFileUpload.js` - remove console.log statements

### Option 3: Keep Current Version

The current version actually has better UI with:
- File icons
- Better buttons
- Card layouts
- Improved visuals

You might want to keep it and just:
1. Add back the "Connect to Host" button
2. Make LAN address dynamic instead of hardcoded

Would you like me to do Option 3 instead? It's much simpler and gives you the best of both worlds.
