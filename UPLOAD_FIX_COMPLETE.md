# Upload Fix & PIN Protection - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. File Upload Not Working - **FIXED**
**Root Cause**: Missing `onFileSelect` callback prop in FileUploadZone component.

**Solution**: Added the callback handler in App.jsx.

### 2. PIN Modal Always Showing - **FIXED**
**Root Cause**: Upload flow always showed PIN modal, blocking normal uploads.

**Solution**: 
- Added PIN protection toggle checkbox (disabled by default)
- Upload directly when toggle is OFF
- Show PIN modal only when toggle is ON

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Default Behavior (PIN Protection OFF):
```
1. User selects file
2. User clicks "Upload"
3. File uploads immediately ✓
4. No PIN modal appears
```

### With PIN Protection (Toggle ON):
```
1. User checks "🔒 Enable PIN Protection"
2. User selects file
3. User clicks "Upload"
4. PIN modal appears
5. User sets PIN or skips
6. File uploads with/without PIN
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### Frontend Changes:

#### 1. App.jsx
```javascript
// Added state
const [pinProtectionEnabled, setPinProtectionEnabled] = useState(false);

// Modified upload handler
const handleUpload = async () => {
  // ... validation ...
  
  if (pinProtectionEnabled) {
    // Show PIN modal
    setPendingFile(file);
    setShowSetPinModal(true);
  } else {
    // Upload directly without PIN
    await performUpload(file, null);
  }
};

// Separated upload logic
const performUpload = async (file, pin) => {
  // Actual upload implementation
};
```

#### 2. FileUploadZone.jsx
```javascript
// Added PIN protection toggle
<div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-sm">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    id="pinProtection"
    checked={pinProtectionEnabled}
    onChange={onTogglePinProtection}
  />
  <label htmlFor="pinProtection">
    🔒 Enable PIN Protection
  </label>
</div>
```

### Backend (No Changes Needed):
- Backend already supports optional PIN parameter
- Works with both PIN and non-PIN uploads

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Normal Upload (No PIN)
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
2. Ensure "🔒 Enable PIN Protection" is **UNCHECKED**
3. Select a small test file (e.g., text file)
4. Click "Upload" button
5. **Expected**: File uploads immediately, no modal appears
6. **Verify**: File appears in list without 🔒 icon

### Test 2: Upload with PIN
1. **CHECK** the "🔒 Enable PIN Protection" checkbox
2. Select a file
3. Click "Upload"
4. **Expected**: PIN modal appears
5. Enter PIN: "1234"
6. Confirm PIN: "1234"
7. Click "Set PIN"
8. **Expected**: File uploads successfully
9. **Verify**: File appears in list WITH 🔒 icon

### Test 3: Skip PIN
1. Check PIN protection toggle
2. Select file
3. Click Upload
4. In modal, click "Skip (No PIN)"
5. **Expected**: File uploads without PIN
6. **Verify**: File appears without 🔒 icon

### Test 4: Cancel Upload
1. Check PIN protection toggle
2. Select file
3. Click Upload
4. In modal, click "Cancel"
5. **Expected**: Upload cancelled, file not uploaded

### Test 5: Download PIN-Protected File
1. Upload file with PIN "1234"
2. Click "Download" on that file
3. **Expected**: PIN verification modal appears
4. Enter PIN: "1234"
5. Click "Verify & Download"
6. **Expected**: File downloads successfully

### Test 6: Wrong PIN
1. Click Download on PIN-protected file
2. Enter wrong PIN: "9999"
3. Click "Verify & Download"
4. **Expected**: Download fails with 403 error

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Upload Still Fails:

#### Check Browser Console (F12):
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
"Files selected: 1"
"Starting upload for file: test.txt Size: 1234 PIN: No"
"Upload result: {success: true, ...}"
```

#### Check Network Tab:
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Try uploading
3. Look for POST request to `/upload`
4. Check:
   - Status: Should be 201
   - Response: Should have `filename` and `url`
   - If 401: Authentication issue
   - If 500: Server error

#### Check Backend Terminal:
```
INFO - File uploaded successfully: 20251029094500_test.txt (1234 bytes)
```

### Common Issues:

#### Issue: "Upload failed: 401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Server has ACCESS_PIN enabled
**Solution**: 
- Check if ACCESS_PIN environment variable is set
- If yes, authenticate first via login modal
- Or remove ACCESS_PIN from environment

#### Issue: "Upload failed: CORS error"
**Cause**: CORS configuration mismatch
**Solution**: 
- Backend is running on port 5000
- Frontend on port 5173
- CORS should allow localhost:5173
- Check app.py ALLOWED_ORIGINS

#### Issue: "Upload failed: Network error"
**Cause**: Backend not running
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check if Python server is running
Get-Process python

# If not running, start it:
cd d:\Projects\WifiX
python app.py
```

#### Issue: File size error
**Cause**: File too large
**Solution**:
- Frontend limit: 1GB (in App.jsx)
- Backend limit: 1GB (in app.py)
- Constants.js shows 100MB (outdated)
- Use files under 100MB for testing
